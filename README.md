# TrackEZ

# Problem :  

# Who: FSM FordPass S/w engineers, TPM, DLs

What: Booking or reserving a digital device (eg: Iphone, Android, Tablet, TDK, Laptops, iOT devices etc) within FSM organization has been very inefficient and need improvement over entire workflow. 

# Why:  

Powerapps based existing process is inherited from QET model & cloned for adoption

Workflow doesn’t focus on user centric features like (Reports / internal Transfer of devices / On-behalf )

Lack of on-time device availability information for testers to plan their Application Test plan

Current process doesn’t offer past usage trends & future predictability 

# Impacting / Results: 

Product features missing deliverable timeline due to delay in device availability to Testers

Product quality that depends on H/w device testing is compromised.

# Proposed Solution:

Build a mobile based device tracking application (flutter based architecture) that would enable the users with following benefits:

Anytime / anywhere access using mobile devices leveraging open source ecosystem (Firebase)

Provides features like evaluate usage metrics of devices procured, usage pattern & metrics for evaluation

Supports managers with forecasting device requirement based on their project / product strategy & timeline

Future possibilities to scale the solution to other areas in FSM and FBS
